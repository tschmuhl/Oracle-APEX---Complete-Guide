## Module 1 - Creating an Account & APEX Workspace

An APEX Workspace can be acquired in 2 ways. The first being through the Oracle Cloud Free Tier and the alternatively through apex.oracle.com. I suggest you sign up through the Oracle Cloud Free Tier as this allows you to take advantage of Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP). There are a few more steps to sign up with ATP but you get a lot more. First with ATP all the mundane activities like database maintenance/cleanup, backup, security, and performance managed by Oracle. This will allow you to focus on developing high quality applications. Second, with ATP you get access to SQL Developer Web and Oracle Machine Learning SQL Notebooks among other products.
