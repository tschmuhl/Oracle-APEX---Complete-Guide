# Oracle APEX - Complete Guide

## Module 1 - What is Oracle APEX?

Oracle APEX can be generically described as a low code web application development tool that runs on top of the Oracle Database. With the release of the Oracle Cloud Free Tier you can quickly and easily get started developing modern web applications for free. APEX is a part of the Always Free tier so any application you create should be available indefinitely provided you are still within the limitations of the Always Free services. The full list of Always Free cloud services can be found at: [Oracle Cloud Free Tier](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/)

Creating applications is done through the browser based IDE called the "Application Builder". This is where you will use drag and drop functionality to build the basic layout of your application. You can also leverage the capabilities of CSS/HTML and JavaScript to give your application a visually stunning front end. And as this is an Oracle product, SQL and PL/SQL are fully integrated for any data endeavor you may come across.

## Getting Started - Create an Oracle Cloud Free Tier Account

An APEX Workspace can be acquired in 2 ways. The first being through the Oracle Cloud Free Tier and the alternatively through apex.oracle.com. I suggest you go through the Oracle Cloud Free tier as this ensures that as long as your workspace is active, it will never be purged.
