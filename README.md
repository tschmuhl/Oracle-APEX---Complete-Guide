# Oracle APEX - Complete Guide

## Getting Started - What is Oracle APEX?

Oracle APEX can be generically described as a low code web application development platform that runs on top of the Oracle Database. With the release of the Oracle Cloud Free Tier you can quickly and easily get started developing APEX applications completely free of charge. The Oracle Cloud Free Tier is a combination of the Always Free Services and a 30-day Free Trial promotion where you can access a wider range of Oracle products. Because APEX is a part of the Always Free Tier any application you create should be available indefinitely provided you are still within the limitations of the Always Free Services. The full list of Always Free Cloud Services and Free Trial capabilities can be found at: [Oracle Cloud Free Tier](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/). Lastly, if you're interested in learning more about APEX on Always Free see my link?

Creating APEX applications is done through the browser based IDE called the "Application Builder". This is where you will use drag and drop functionality to build the basic layout of your application. You can also leverage the capabilities of CSS/HTML and JavaScript to give your application a visually stunning front end. And as this is an Oracle product, SQL and PL/SQL are fully integrated for all your data and database needs.

## Course Objectives

This course is intended to give you a fully immersive experience into the world of Oracle APEX. Foremost, you will learn how to use and develop APEX applications from scratch, but that's not all. You will learn how to interact with the Oracle database using SQL and PL/SQL. Further modules will show you step-by-step how to use CSS and HTML to customize the look and feel of your applications. Each module will have a video lesson describing the topic in general and examples demonstrating use of the topic within APEX that you can follow along with. In the homework section of each module you will be tasked with applying the topic on your own and finally a short quiz to show assess whether you have mastered the topic or concept.

My philosophy is that students learn best by real world application. So that is why in each module I give you an ample amount of exercises in the homework to practice on your own. As you practice try to think how you would want to apply the concept to an idea you have for an app or how could your business benefit from what you are learning. Relating what you have learned to something that is important to you is key skill that ensures you retain the new information.

This course will follow an open-source model and I will provide to you all the materials you need so that you can check the solutions if something is still unclear after the video module. You will also have the code available so that you can test and repurpose it for your own needs. I will also try to provide useful resource material for further study, should you be interested.
