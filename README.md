# Oracle APEX - Complete Guide

## Module 1 - What is Oracle APEX?

Oracle APEX can be generically described as a low code web application development platform that runs on top of the Oracle Database. With the release of the Oracle Cloud Free Tier you can quickly and easily get started developing APEX applications completely free of charge. The Oracle Cloud Free Tier is a combination of the Always Free Services and a 30-day Free Trial promotion where you can access a wider range of Oracle products. Because APEX is a part of the Always Free Tier any application you create should be available indefinitely provided you are still within the limitations of the Always Free Services. The full list of Always Free Cloud Services and Free Trial capabilities can be found at: [Oracle Cloud Free Tier](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/). Lastly, if you're interested in learning more about APEX on Always Free see my link?

Creating APEX applications is done through the browser based IDE called the "Application Builder". This is where you will use drag and drop functionality to build the basic layout of your application. You can also leverage the capabilities of CSS/HTML and JavaScript to give your application a visually stunning front end. And as this is an Oracle product, SQL and PL/SQL are fully integrated for all your data and database needs.

## Getting Started - Creating an Account

An APEX Workspace can be acquired in 2 ways. The first being through the Oracle Cloud Free Tier and the alternatively through apex.oracle.com. I suggest you sign up through the Oracle Cloud Free tier as this allows you to take advantage of Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP) and have mundane activities like database maintenance/cleanup, backup, security, and performance managed by Oracle. This will allow you to focus on developing high quality applications.
